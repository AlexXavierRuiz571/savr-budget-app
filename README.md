# 💸 Savr: Budget Simulation App

**Savr** is a responsive budget simulation app built from scratch as a cumulative project alongside my learning in the **TripleTen Software Engineering program**. This project brings together everything I've learned so far — from semantic HTML and modular CSS to clean, event-driven JavaScript — and demonstrates real-world front-end practices.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Apply knowledge from TripleTen sprints in a single, focused build
- Practice responsive layout and BEM-style CSS organization
- Reinforce JavaScript fundamentals with real-time DOM interaction
- Lay the groundwork for future React and full-stack refactoring

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — semantic structure with accessibility in mind
- **CSS3** — modular styles using BEM naming and dark monochromatic color scheme (maroon/black/silver)
- **JavaScript (vanilla)** — clean event-driven code for budget logic and interactivity
- **Git & GitHub** — source control, versioning, and collaboration

---

## 📱 Features

- Set a monthly income and track real-time balance
- Add expenses by name, amount, and category
- Delete individual expenses
- Auto-calculated total income, total expenses, and remaining balance
- Dynamic year in footer
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

---

## 🖼️ UI Style

- **Color Theme:** Maroon, black, and silver (monochromatic)
- **Component Layout:** Header, budget input, expenses list, and footer
- **CSS Architecture:** Block-based BEM structure with separated files per section

---

## 🚧 Roadmap

- [ ] Add localStorage for persistent data
- [ ] Convert to React components after React sprint
- [ ] Add chart or visual breakdown (Chart.js or SVG)
- [ ] Filter expenses by category
- [ ] Add login/auth for user-based data saving

## 🤖 AI Assistance

Throughout the development of this project, I used AI tools (ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot) to assist with:

- Structuring modular CSS and BEM naming
- Debugging JavaScript logic
- Planning and writing README documentation

All code and decisions were made by me, with AI used as a development support resource.
