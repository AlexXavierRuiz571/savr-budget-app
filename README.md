# 💸 Savr: Budget Tracker App

**Savr** is a responsive budget simulation app built from scratch as a cumulative project alongside my learning in the **TripleTen Software Engineering program**. This project brings together everything I've learned so far from semantic HTML, modular CSS to clean, and event-driven JavaScript to simulate real-world budgeting behaviors.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Apply TripleTen sprint knowledge in a single, focused build
- Practice responsive layout, validation, and DOM interaction
- Use BEM-style CSS and dark color theming
- Lay groundwork for full-stack and React conversion

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — semantic structure with accessibility in mind
- **CSS3** — modular styles using BEM naming and dark monochromatic color scheme (maroon/black/silver)
- **JavaScript (vanilla)** — clean event-driven code for budget logic and interactivity
- **Git & GitHub** — source control, versioning, and collaboration

---

## 📱 Features

- Set a monthly income
- Add/delete expenses by name, amount, and category
- Auto-calculate total income, total expenses, and remaining balance
- Live form validation with button state toggling
- Custom input styling, spinner removal, and focus states
- Context menu alerts on right-click
- Dynamic current year in footer
- Fully responsive across devices

---

## 🖼️ UI Style

- Colors: Maroon, black, silver (monochromatic)
- Font: Orbitron for headings, system sans-serif for body
- Structure: Block-based layout: Budget Input, Expense Form, Summary
- Styling: No shadows, no spinners, accessible focus/hover states section

---

## 🚧 To-Do List

- [ ] Add localStorage for persistent budget state
- [ ] Create tracker section with visual progress bar
- [ ] Add user profile for saved budgets
- [ ] Integrate real-world data for estimated costs
- [ ] Include icons and animations for UI polish
- [ ] Filter expenses by category
- [ ] Rebuild using React components

## 🤖 AI Assistance

Throughout the development of this project, I used AI tools (ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot) to assist with:

- Structuring modular CSS and BEM naming
- Debugging JavaScript logic
- Planning and writing README documentation

All code and decisions were made by me, with AI used as a development support resource.
